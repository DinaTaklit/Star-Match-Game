> Note: it is same app [here](https://github.com/DinaTaklit/StarMatchGame).
> But create with `npx reactful` instead of `npx create-react-app`
> `npx reactful` create the react app with **bare-bone** repo that is **fully configured for server-side** rend and that is ejected by default.

## Get Started 

- Create the app using `npx reactful app_name`
- TO run the app use `npm start` and open it in the `localhost:4242/` by defualt. It will run two command webpack and the server on the backend.

The usage of  `npx reactful` is exactly like `npx create-react-app` repo but the differences is:
- This will be bare-bone, no extra features, just the absolure minimum things that you need
- It will be also ejected by default so you will get all the scripts and configuration flat and ready for you to configure
- This app will be server side ready by default 
- This command will create a new directory under the current working directory. It will install the dependencies. Once done it will give you some instrunction how to start the app.
- The command configure the webpack and configure some task for you to run webpak in production and to configure things for production.
- It also configure a way for you to create a component using the reactful command.
